Design Overview



Frontend (Tkinter GUI):

Display an image of a hen along with jumbled words.
Provide two shaded boxes for nouns and adjectives.
Implement drag-and-drop functionality to move words into the correct boxes.
Provide 6 level buttons, allowing access to a level only after completing the previous one.
Login system to track user progress.
Display score/level completion status.
Backend (SQLite for persistent storage, JSON for easy state management):

Store user progress (which levels are completed).
Store list of words per level with their correct category.
Load game progress and update on completion.

✅ Drag & Drop: Implemented using bind events in Tkinter (to be added).
✅ Persistent Progress: Tracked in SQLite.
✅ Word Data Storage: Stored in JSON (words.json).
✅ Scalability: More words and levels can be added easily.
✅ Modular Design: Separation of frontend and backend logic.

Explanation:
Drag & Drop Setup: Each word button is bound to start_drag(), on_drag(), and on_drop().
Movement Calculation: on_drag() calculates the new position dynamically.
Drop Detection: on_drop() checks whether the word is inside the correct box.
Highlighting Correct Drops: Colors change when a word is dropped in the right category.

Key Features in main.py
✅ User Login & Progress Storage
A simple login screen allows users to enter their username.
Progress is fetched from SQLite database via database.py.
✅ Level Selection System
The user cannot access higher levels until the previous one is completed.
Level buttons are dynamically enabled/disabled based on user progress.
✅ Drag & Drop Integration
Words can be dragged and dropped into adjective/noun boxes.
Uses DragDrop from drag_drop.py for managing movements.
✅ Word Classification Logic
Words are categorized as adjectives or nouns.
If the words are placed correctly, progress is saved.
Incorrect answers prompt a retry message.
✅ User-Friendly UI
Background colors and font styles improve readability.
The game dynamically adjusts based on level selection.
